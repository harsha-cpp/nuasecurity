1) SQL Injection

Direct integer injection via an API query parameter used unsafely in a SQL WHERE id = ... expression.

String-based injection in a search endpoint using LIKE '%...%' built by concatenating user input into the SQL string.

2) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Reflected XSS: search results or query echo rendered into server-side or client-side HTML without escaping.

Stored XSS: user-submitted message saved to the DB and displayed later in an admin UI or public page without sanitization.

3) Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

Email/template rendering that interpolates user-provided values into server templates which support expressions.

Customizable feed/title rendering where a user-controlled value is processed by the server-side template engine.

4) Vulnerable Components / Dependencies

Outdated server-side email or utility package with a known remote code execution vulnerability.

Old client-side library version with a known DOM/selector XSS or parsing bug used in the frontend.

5) Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Fetching draft content by a numeric ID without verifying the requester’s permissions/ownership.

Viewing or editing comments by passing a comment ID without access checks, exposing hidden/admin-only content.

6) XML External Entity (XXE)

Server endpoint accepting XML uploads/imports and parsing them with external entity resolution enabled.

An alternate XML-based API accepting user XML payloads that are parsed without disabling DTDs or external entities.

7) Path Traversal / Unsafe file access

Serving or loading images using a user-provided filename/path that isn’t validated or normalized.

Dynamic template/resource loader that concatenates user input into a filesystem path and reads it directly.

8) Sensitive Data Exposure

Publicly accessible configuration or backup file (containing secrets) accidentally served by the app.

Debug or diagnostics endpoint that prints stack, environment variables, or credentials in responses.

9) Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

URL-preview or fetch endpoint that retrieves arbitrary remote URLs from user input without allowlisting.

Webhook/callback handler that accepts a callback URL and the server makes a request to that URL without validation.

10) Open Redirect

Redirect endpoint that takes a return or next URL from the query and redirects there without validation.

Affiliate/forwarding endpoint that maps a short param to an external URL and forwards users to unvalidated targets.
